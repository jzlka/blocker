cd blocker/blocker/blockerd
make && cd ../ && ./sign.sh && cd blockerd
```
or
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jzlka/blocker.git
cd blocker/blocker/
#xcbuild TODO
```
Final binary (**_blockerd_**) is located in the folder with source files (in case of build using Makekile).

### Makefile parameters

    * make              - build the tool
    * make test         - run basic tests (**TODO**)
    * make clean        - clean compiled binary, object files and *.dSYM files

[//]: # (    * make clean-all    - clean, clean-tests, clean-doc)
[//]: # (    * make libs         - run helper script to download & install PF_RING/netmap/PFQ [interactive])
[//]: # (    * make pf_ring      - build against PF_RING downloaded in libs/ folder)
[//]: # (    * make netmap       - build against netmap downloaded in libs/ folder)
[//]: # (    * make pfq          - build against PFQ downloaded in libs/ folder)
